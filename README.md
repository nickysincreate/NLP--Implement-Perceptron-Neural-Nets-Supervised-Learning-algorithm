# NLP--Implement-Perceptron-Neural-Nets-Supervised-Learning-algorithm

Implemented simple but effective machine learning model, the perceptron, and applying it to a binary text classification task (i.e., spam detection).Implemented both standard and averaged perceptron model on the corpus containing 44000 E-mail data and then to classify dev data consisting of 22000 mail records. and to Calculated the Average, Precision and F-score on actual result.
